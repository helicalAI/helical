# Model Card for Evo 2

## Model Details

**Model Name:** Evo 2  

**Model Versions:** 1B, 7B and 40B

**Model Description:** Evo 2 is a next-generation genomic model that integrates DNA, RNA, and protein data across all domains of life. It leverages the StripedHyena 2 architecture, combining convolutional, linear attention, and state-space models to efficiently process long sequences and capture complex biological patterns. Evo 2 is trained on a vast dataset encompassing trillions of nucleotides from eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, enabling broad cross-species applications and insights into human diseases, agriculture, and environmental science.

## Model Type

**Architecture:** StripedHyena 2 (Multi-hybrid)  
**Domain:** Genomics and Proteomics  
**Input Data:** DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

## Model Purpose

**Intended Use:**  
- **Genomic Analysis:** Predicting mutation impacts, annotating genomes, and identifying essential genes.
- **Protein Analysis:** Understanding protein structure and function.
- **Cross-Species Applications:** Facilitating insights across different domains of life.
- **Biological Design:** Generating complex biological systems.

**Use Cases**

- **Variant Impact Prediction:** Accurately predicting the effects of mutations across species.
- **Gene Essentiality Analysis:** Identifying crucial genes in various organisms.
- **Biological Design:** Designing genome-scale sequences and controlling chromatin accessibility.
- **Therapeutic Applications:** Informing human disease research and agricultural innovations.

## Training Data

**Pretraining:**  

- 1B model is trained on 1T tokens up to 8,192 tokens
- 7B base model is trained on 2.1T tokens up to 8,192 tokens
- 7B model is trained on 4T tokens up to 1M tokens
- 40B base model is trained on 6.6T tokens at length 1,024 tokens and 1.1T tokens at length 8,192 tokens
- 40B model is trained rained on 9.3T tokens up to 1M tokens
- For both the 7B and 40B models, a multi-stage pretraining approach was implemented. This began with an initial pretraining phase focused exclusively on sequences of 8,192 (1024 as well as 8,192 for the 40B model) tokens, followed by a progressive increase in context length up to 1M tokens.

**Preprocessing:**  

- Utilizes novel data augmentation and weighting strategies to prioritize functional genetic elements.

## Model Performance

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- Accuracy in mutation impact prediction, gene essentiality identification, and genome annotation tasks.
- AUROC for exon classification tasks.

## Model Limitations

**Known Limitations:**  
- Performance may vary based on the complexity and length of input sequences.
- Limited by the availability of diverse and high-quality training data.
- Only runnable on NVIDIA GPUs with compute capability â‰¥8.9
- These are very large models and need significant compute to run

- DNA, RNA, and protein sequences in standard formats.

**Output Format**  
- Sequence embeddings and predictions for various biological tasks.

**Example Usage For Getting Embeddings**

```python 
from helical.models.evo_2 import Evo2, Evo2Config

evo2_config = Evo2Config(batch_size=1)

evo2 = Evo2(configurer=evo2_config)

sequences = ["ACGT" * 1000]

dataset = evo2.process_data(data)

embeddings = evo2.get_embeddings(dataset)
# Get the last embedding of each sequence
print(embeddings["embeddings"][0][embeddings["original_lengths"][0]-1])
print(embeddings["embeddings"][1][embeddings["original_lengths"][1]-1])
print(embeddings["original_lengths"])
```

**Example Usage For Sequence Generation**

```python
from helical.models.evo_2 import Evo2, Evo2Config

evo2_config = Evo2Config(batch_size=1)

evo2 = Evo2(configurer=evo2_config)

sequences = ["ACGT" * 1000]

dataset = evo2.process_data(data)

generate = evo2.generate(dataset)

# Print the generated sequences
print(generate)
```
