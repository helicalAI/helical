# What is Helical ?

Helical provides a framework for state-of-the-art pre-trained bio foundation models on genomics and transcriptomics modalities.

Helical simplifies the entire application lifecycle when building with bio foundation models. You will be able to:

- Leverage the latest bio foundation models through our easy-to-use python package
- Run example notebooks on key downstream tasks from examples

We will update this repo on a regular basis with new models, benchmarks, modalities and functions - so stay tuned.
Letâ€™s build the most exciting AI-for-Bio community together!

## What's new?
### TranscriptFormer
We have integrated [TranscriptFormer](https://github.com/czi-ai/transcriptformer) into our helical package and have made a model card for it in our [Transcriptformer model folder](helical/models/transcriptformer/README.md). If you would like to test the model, take a look at our [example notebook](examples/notebooks/Geneformer-vs-TranscriptFormer.ipynb)!

### ðŸ§¬ Introducing Helix-mRNA-v0: Unlocking new frontiers & use cases in mRNA therapy ðŸ§¬
Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the release of our first-ever mRNA Bio Foundation Model, designed to:

1) Be Efficient, handling long sequence lengths effortlessly

2) Balance Diversity & Specificity, leveraging a 2-step pre-training approach

3) Deliver High-Resolution, using single nucleotides as a resolution

Check out our <a href="https://www.helical-ai.com/blog/helix-mrna-v0" target="_blank">blog post</a> to learn more about our approach and read the <a href="https://helical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_cards/helix_mrna/" target="_blank">model card</a> to get started.

## Installation

We recommend installing Helical within a conda environment with the commands below (run them in your terminal) - this step is optional:
```bash
conda create --name helical-package python=3.11.8
conda activate helical-package
```

To install the latest pip release of our Helical package, you can run the command below:
```bash
pip install helical
```

To install the latest Helical package, you can run the command below:
```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/helicalAI/helical.git
```

Alternatively, clone the repo and install it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/helicalAI/helical.git
pip install .
```

[Optional] To install mamba-ssm and causal-conv1d use the command below:
```bash
pip install helical[mamba-ssm]
```
or in case you're installing from the Helical repo cloned locally:
```bash
pip install .[mamba-ssm]
```

Note: make sure your machine has GPU(s) and Cuda installed. Currently this is a requirement for the packages mamba-ssm and causal-conv1d.

### Singularity (Optional)
If you desire to run your code in a singularity file, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/helicalAI/helical/blob/release/singularity.def" target="_blank">singularity.def</a> file and build an apptainer with it:
```
apptainer build --sandbox singularity/helical singularity.def
```

and then shell into the sandbox container (use the --nv flag if you have a GPU available):
```
apptainer shell --nv --fakeroot singularity/helical/
```

## Demo & Use Cases

To run examples, be sure to have installed the Helical package (see Installation) and that it is up-to-date.

You can look directly into the example folder above and download the script of your choice, look into our [documentation](https://helical.readthedocs.io/) for step-by-step guides or directly clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/helicalAI/helical.git
```
Within the `example/notebooks` folder, open the notebook of your choice. We recommend starting with `Quick-Start-Tutorial.ipynb`.
