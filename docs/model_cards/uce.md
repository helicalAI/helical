# Model Card for Universal Cell Embedding (UCE)

## Model Details

**Model Name:** Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) v1.0 \
**Model Version:** 1.0 \
**Model Description:** A large pre-trained model for creating universal representations of cell types across species. The model performs tasks such as cell type annotation, hypothesis generation, and integrating diverse single-cell datasets.

## Model Type

**Architecture:** Transformer-based \
**Domain:** Cell Biology, Bioinformatics \
**Input Data:** Single-cell transcriptomics data \

## Model Purpose

**Intended Use:**  
- Research in cell biology and bioinformatics
- Annotation of cell types in large single-cell datasets
- Hypothesis generation in biological research

**Out-of-Scope Use Cases:**  
- Direct clinical decision making without human oversight
- Applications outside the scope of single-cell data analysis

## Training Data

**Data Sources:**  
- Public single-cell transcriptomic datasets (e.g., CellXGene, various GEO datasets)
- Data from multiple species and tissues to ensure diversity

**Data Volume:**  
- Integrated dataset with 36 million cells, more than 1,000 cell types, from hundreds of experiments

**Preprocessing:**  
- Standardized to remove low-quality data
- Balanced to ensure representation across species and cell types

## Model Performance

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for cell type annotation
- Embedding quality evaluated by ability to uncover biological insights

**Performance Benchmarks:**  
- Precision and recall metrics in line with current state-of-the-art models
- Emergent behaviors such as identifying developmental lineages and novel species integration

**Testing Data:**  
- Held-out subsets of training datasets
- External validation using diverse single-cell datasets

## Ethical Considerations

**Bias and Fairness:**  
- Inclusion of diverse species and cell types to minimize bias
- Continuous evaluation for potential biases

**Privacy:**  
- Training data sourced from public datasets with appropriate usage permissions
- No private or sensitive genetic data used without consent

**Mitigations:**  
- Regular audits to identify and address biases
- Collaboration with ethicists and domain experts

## Model Limitations

**Known Limitations:**  
- May not generalize well to novel species or rare cell types not present in training data
- Performance may vary with different single-cell sequencing technologies

**Future Improvements:**  
- Ongoing integration of new datasets
- Enhancements to model architecture for better handling of rare cell types

## How to Use

**Input Format:**  
- Single-cell transcriptomics data in appropriate formats (e.g., h5ad)

**Output Format:**  
- JSON or h5ad format with cell type annotations and embeddings

**Example Usage:**
```python
from helical.models.uce.model import UCE, UCEConfig
import anndata as ad

configurer=UCEConfig(batch_size=10)
uce = UCE(configurer=configurer)
ann_data = ad.read_h5ad("dataset.h5ad")
data_loader = uce.process_data(ann_data[:10])
embeddings = uce.get_embeddings(data_loader)

print(embeddings.shape)
```
