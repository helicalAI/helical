# Model Card for Geneformer

## Model Details

**Model Name:** Geneformer  
**Model Versions:** 1.0 and 2.0  
**Model Description:** Geneformer is a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model pretrained on a large-scale corpus of single-cell transcriptomes. It is designed to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. The model performs various downstream tasks such as gene network mapping, disease modeling, and therapeutic target identification.

In version 2.0, Geneformer introduces a cancer-tuned model variant using domain-specific continual learning. This variant was developed to address the exclusion of malignant cells from the initial pretraining due to their propensity for gain-of-function mutations. The cancer-tuned model underwent additional training with ~14 million cells from cancer studies, including matched healthy controls, to provide contrasting context. This approach allows the model to better understand gene network rewiring in malignancy while maintaining its general knowledge of gene network dynamics.

When to use each model:
- Base pretrained model: Use for general transcriptomic analysis tasks and non-cancer-specific applications.
- Cancer-tuned model: Use for cancer-specific analyses, tumor microenvironment studies, and predicting factors that could shift cells to tumor-restricting or immune-activating states.

## Model Versions

Geneformer has two main versions:

**Version 1.0:**

- Pretrained on approximately 30 million single-cell transcriptomes
- Input size of 2048 genes per cell
- Focused on single-task learning

**Version 2.0:**

- Pretrained on Genecorpus-103M, comprising ~103 million human single-cell transcriptomes
- Initial self-supervised pretraining with ~95 million cells, excluding cells with high mutational burdens
- Expanded input/context size of 4096 genes per cell
- Employs multi-task learning to jointly learn cell types, tissues, disease states, and developmental stages
- Includes a cancer-tuned model variant using domain-specific continual learning
- Supports model quantization for resource-efficient fine-tuning and inference

Key improvements in v2.0:
- Larger and more diverse pretraining corpus
- Increased model parameters and expanded input size
- Multi-task learning for context-specific representations of gene network dynamics
- Improved zero-shot predictions in diverse downstream tasks
- Cancer-specific tuning for tumor microenvironment analysis
